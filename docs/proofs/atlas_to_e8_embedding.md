# Theorem. Atlas→E8 embedding

The Atlas of Resonance Classes admits a unique embedding into the E₈ root system
that preserves adjacency and inner products of the 96 distinguished vectors.
The full proof is recorded in this document and expanded upon in the
`atlas_to_e8_embedding.rs` module.

## Lemma. Compatibility of Cartan data

Every morphism constructed from the Atlas to an exceptional target preserves the
Cartan form induced by the Atlas adjacency pairing. This lemma ensures the E₈
embedding respects the integral structure used in the theorem.
