# Copilot Instructions
- **Project Scope** Atlas Embeddings is a Rust+Lean proof project showing the five exceptional Lie groups emerging from the 96-vertex Atlas via categorical operations and an explicit E₈ embedding.
- **Core Modules** `src/atlas` encodes the labeled 96-node graph, `src/arithmetic` provides exact rationals/half-integers, `src/embedding` maps Atlas vertices into the 240-root E₈ system, `src/groups` layers G₂→E₈ constructions, while `cartan`, `weyl`, and `categorical` supply shared algebra.
- **Data Invariants** Never introduce floating point or unsafe code; all arithmetic must stay in `HalfInteger`, `Rational`, or exact integer forms and respect overflow checks enforced by profiles.
- **Documentation-Driven** Treat doc comments as the paper—new APIs need narrative module/docs first, and public items must stay documented per `missing_docs` lint.
- **Must Use Attributes** Preserve pervasive must-use annotations and ergonomic helper APIs; if adding new types, follow the pattern of const constructors plus explicit conversion helpers.
- **Atlas Labels** Maintain the 6-tuple `(e1,e2,e3,d45,e6,e7)` convention; adjacency is Hamming-1 on active coordinates and mirror symmetry is the `e7` flip handled via `mirror_pair`—tests assume this encoding.
- **Embedding Logic** When touching `embedding/weyl_action.rs` or related code, keep Weyl actions expressed via `WeylElement<8>` and reuse `apply_weyl_to_embedding`; unit tests expect embeddings as `[Vector8; 96]` arrays with deterministic ordering.
- **Group Construction Pattern** Each exceptional group exposes `from_atlas`, root counting, rank, Cartan access, and Weyl order checks—mirror those signatures and update the matching test in `tests/*_construction.rs` and inclusion chains.
- **Testing Workflow** Use `make test` / `make test-unit` / `make test-int`; CI-equivalent is `make verify` (format-check + check --all-features + lint + docs + tests). Property tests live in `tests/property_tests.rs` and rely on `proptest` seeds in `tests/property_tests.proptest-regressions`.
- **Feature Flags** Default builds enable the `std` feature; optional `serde` serialization must compile without default features via `cargo check --all-features --no-default-features` (run by `make check`).
- **Docs Builds** `cargo doc --all-features --no-deps` underpins `make docs`; include math-heavy exposition via markdown/LaTeX (keep ASCII outside formulas) and reuse `docs/katex-header.html` for KaTeX when adding new chapters.
- **Docs Folder** Author long-form exposition in `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` and `docs/PAPER_ARCHITECTURE.md`; expand sections via standard Markdown headings and embed formulas with KaTeX-compatible syntax, keeping any new assets self-contained in `docs/`.
- **Benchmarks** Criterion benches live in `benches/`; run `make bench` or `make bench-save` (stores baseline `target/criterion`). Avoid heavy allocations in hot loops to keep orbit computations traceable.
- **Certificates** JSON certificates in `temp/*.json` mirror Rust results; update them only after code-level proof changes and keep schemas stable for downstream verification tooling.
- **Clippy Expectations** Lints deny floating point use and warn on missing error/panic docs; when introducing functions that can fail, provide must-use return values with documented error variants (`thiserror`).
- **Lean Workspace** The `lean4/` directory mirrors the Rust proof: edit modules under `lean4/AtlasEmbeddings/`, run `lake build` from `lean4/`, avoid touching `.lake/` outputs, keep files free of `sorry`, and leverage finite-data tactics (`decide`, `ring`).
- **Cross-Language Consistency** When updating mathematical definitions, reflect the change both in Rust (`src/...`) and Lean (`lean4/AtlasEmbeddings/...`) plus regenerate any affected certificates/tests.
- **Testing Granularity** For focused Rust checks, use `cargo test --test e6_construction` or `cargo test atlas::tests::mirror_symmetry`; keep integration tests deterministic and snapshot-free.
- **Make Targets** `make lint` runs clippy with pedantic/nursery/cargo and strict float bans—fix lint warnings immediately rather than suppressing, except where doc-markdown allowances are already committed for math-heavy modules.
- **Serialization Guardrails** When enabling the `serde` feature, ensure derived `Serialize/Deserialize` implementations respect exact arithmetic types and round-trip property tests in `tests/categorical_operations.rs`.
- **Pulling Data** Any CSV or external data must be transformed into compile-time constants or baked JSON within `docs/`/`temp/`; runtime file IO is intentionally absent from the crate.
- **ResGraph Category** Changes to categorical foundations should update `src/foundations/resgraph.rs`, the associated integration test `tests/resgraph_category_axioms.rs`, and the Lean proofs establishing initiality (Conjecture).
- **Validation Steps** After altering core math (Atlas, embedding, Cartan, Weyl), run `make verify` and `make docs-private`; for Lean updates, run `lake build` and `grep -r "sorry" lean4/AtlasEmbeddings`.
- **Contribution Style** Follow the minimal-complete-unit pattern: land small, fully verified increments with docs/tests instead of staging TODO files—this keeps the project audit trail compact.
