# Hologram v2 Repo Skeleton

This repository implements the v2 plan:
- Unify boundary/schedule/response/signature with 48/256/12_288, R96, 3/8.
- Ship math-clean, acceptance-tested libraries: R96 resonance, RL budgets over Z_96 with Z_2 collapse, HRF-F scaffold, DPI compressors, GG architecture.

Status: skeleton + stubs. Replace all TODOs.
